RNA-Seq Analysis Pipeline
This repository contains a complete pipeline for RNA-seq analysis, starting from raw FASTQ files and ending with differential expression analysis and data visualization.

Workflow Overview
The pipeline consists of the following steps:

Quality Control: Assess raw sequencing data quality using FastQC.
Read Trimming: Remove low-quality bases and adapter sequences using Trimmomatic.
Alignment: Map reads to a reference genome using HISAT2.
Quantification: Count the number of reads aligned to each gene using featureCounts.
Differential Gene Expression: Perform differential gene expression analysis with DESeq2 in R.
Visualization: Generate PCA plots, volcano plots, and heatmaps to visualize the results.

How to Use This Pipeline
1. Prerequisites
You will need the following tools installed to run this pipeline:

FastQC: Quality control for raw reads.
Trimmomatic: Trimming of low-quality reads and adapters.
HISAT2: Read alignment to a reference genome.
SAMtools: For converting, sorting, and indexing SAM/BAM files.
featureCounts: Counting reads mapped to genes.
R and DESeq2: For differential gene expression analysis.
Additionally, ensure that you have:

A reference genome and annotation file (FASTA and GTF).
Your raw sequencing files (FASTQ format).
2. Running the Pipeline
You can run each step of the pipeline manually or automate it with a shell script. Below are the individual steps.

Step 1: Quality Control (FastQC)
Run FastQC on your raw sequencing data:

bash
Copy code
fastqc raw_data/*.fastq.gz -o fastqc_output/
Check the fastqc_output/ folder for the HTML reports.

Step 2: Trimming Reads (Trimmomatic)
Use Trimmomatic to clean your raw reads:

bash
Copy code
for file in raw_data/*.fastq.gz
do
  base=$(basename ${file} .fastq.gz)
  java -jar trimmomatic.jar SE -phred33 \
      raw_data/${base}.fastq.gz \
      trimmed_data/${base}_trimmed.fastq.gz \
      LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:36
done
Step 3: Aligning Reads (HISAT2)
Align the trimmed reads to the reference genome:

bash
Copy code
for file in trimmed_data/*_trimmed.fastq.gz
do
  base=$(basename ${file} _trimmed.fastq.gz)
  hisat2 -x reference_index -U ${file} -S alignment/${base}.sam
done
Convert SAM to BAM and sort:

bash
Copy code
for file in alignment/*.sam
do
  base=$(basename ${file} .sam)
  samtools view -bS ${file} | samtools sort -o alignment/${base}.sorted.bam
  samtools index alignment/${base}.sorted.bam
done
Step 4: Gene Counting (featureCounts)
Count reads mapped to genes:

bash
Copy code
featureCounts -T 4 -a genes.gtf -o counts/counts.txt alignment/*.sorted.bam
Step 5: Differential Gene Expression Analysis (DESeq2)
Run DESeq2 in R to perform differential expression analysis. Use the provided R script located in scripts/deseq2_analysis.R.

r
Copy code
# Run the script inside R
source("scripts/deseq2_analysis.R")
The differential expression results will be saved as results/differential_expression_results.csv.

Step 6: Visualization
You can visualize the results using PCA, volcano plots, and heatmaps. These are included in the provided R scripts under the scripts/ folder.

r
Copy code
# Run PCA plot script
source("scripts/plot_pca.R")

# Run Volcano plot script
source("scripts/plot_volcano.R")

# Run Heatmap script
source("scripts/plot_heatmap.R")
The plots will be saved in the figures/ directory.
